# INTRODUCTION

Several economic growth driving factors like labor inputs, employment rate, and GDP growth has shown significant and stable increase in the past decade [1]. Along with this, the average filipino household expenses and poverty rate has also increased [2]. Thus, the economic growth of the Philippines is somewhat complicated.

The Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) Philippines 2020-2024  reflects shared priorities of government, workers, and employers in the country, focusing on employment, labor market governance, and social protection to build back better.  The ILO provides support to its member States in the development of the DWCP aligned with national, social, and economic development priorities of different countries, to help move towards making decent work a reality and to sustain tripartite efforts in ways that are appropriate for them. The ILO contributes to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) through the outcome of decent and productive employment for sustained, greener growth and other outcomes to support inclusive, sustainable, and resilient development in the Philippines. The greatest challenge for the Philippines is to drive the economy to a higher level of growth and job creation. Both real GDP per capital and labor productivity (MDG indicator) barely grew from 1999 to 2002 and it was only in recent years (except during that modest and sustained growth was achieved. The overall goal of Decent Work is to effect positive change in peopleâ€™s lives at the national and local levels. In the Philippines, the Decent Work agenda is used to express employment aspirations and policy goals.

To achieve decent work and economic growth in the Philippines, it is necessary to strengthen technologies and agricultural practices to ensure sustainable growth and provide employment opportunities for the country's residents. Establishing businesses in various regions of the Philippines can also help address the problem of job mismatch, where individuals work in fields unrelated to their educational background, leading to discomfort and dissatisfaction. The attainment of decent work and economic development in the Philippines requires integrated efforts from the government. Strengthening the labor sector can provide opportunities for the population to access employment.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The number of unemployed individuals in the Philippines is estimated to be 4.8 percent, which translates to 2.37 million unemployed Filipinos. This is due to the large population in the Philippines and the insufficient number of available jobs, as new technological inventions are replacing human labor, resulting in many vacant positions. Another concern is the state of our economy, as it can be influenced by a recession, which leads to a contraction in business cycles. 

The addition of people leads to many individuals losing their jobs, which causes poverty among the population. The income earned by people is also insufficient due to the high cost of goods in our country, such as rice and food. Because of the lack of employment, some people work in other countries to mee
t their needs and provide a better future for their families. Therefore, it is better for our government to prioritize our agriculture and products to prevent the rise in prices and to support our farmers in their jobs.

Economic growth as a crucial means for expanding the substantive freedoms that people value. These freedoms are strongly associated with improvements in general living standards, such as greater opportunities for people to become healthier, eat better and live longer (Sen, 1999).

The rise of entrepreneurship and small company ventures is a crucial idea to take into account for alleviating unemployment and encouraging economic growth in the Philippines, in addition to giving agricultural priority and aiding farmers. Supporting and encouraging people to launch their own enterprises can lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth. 

# SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

The proposed project in the Philippines will have a big impact on reducing unemployment and fostering economic development. It focuses on technology, agriculture, and business establishment throughout many regions in order to create jobs. This would result in better livelihoods, a decrease in poverty, and higher levels of living. The proposal would improve worker rights and welfare by fortifying the labor sector, which would guarantee fair working conditions. Additionally, by emphasizing sustainable activities, it supports the aims of sustainable development globally and promotes climate resilience and environmental protection. By encouraging cooperation between the government, employees, and employers, the project's inclusive approach promotes more equal results. The project's ability to create jobs, spur economic growth, combat poverty, enhance working conditions, support sustainable development, and promote social equity make it significant overall.

The proposed project in the Philippines is crucial for tackling issues with unemployment and economic expansion. By improving agricultural methods, agricultural technologies, and business establishment across various locations, it seeks to increase employment prospects. This will boost people's and their families' standard of living while also promoting the growth and development of the economy as a whole. The goal of the project is to provide people with possibilities for quality jobs that will help them escape poverty and advance social inclusion. By addressing job mismatches, enhancing labor market governance, and ensuring just working conditions, it also strives to improve the labor market. The project also supports the Philippines' commitment to the Sustainable Develoment Goals by encouraging sustainable technologies and practices, aiding in environmental protection, and promoting sustainable development. The project places a focus on triangular cooperation.

# METHODS

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, focuses on promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Achieving SDG 8 requires addressing various challenges related to job creation, labor rights, economic productivity, and income inequality. Promoting decent work is essential for achieving sustainable development, reducing inequalities, and fostering inclusive economic growth. By prioritizing labor rights, fostering social dialogue, addressing informal employment, promoting gender equality, investing in education, supporting responsible business practices, and strengthening social protection, societies can create an enabling environment for decent work. Governments, employers, workers' organizations, and civil society must collaborate to implement these strategies, ensuring a brighter and more equitable future for all. By prioritizing decent work, we build the foundation for sustainable development and a more just and inclusive society.

# EXPECTED OUTPUTS

In furtherance of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, the goal of this study is to provide a comparative analysis between regions that have similarities when it comes to most factors affecting economic growth, yet differ when it comes to un/employment rate. The researchers will identify the driving factors of those regions that has relatively more success in the workforce's progress. The pratices done in those regions will also be analyzed by the researchers in order to determine what practices will be the most suitable for battling unemployment in the Philippines.
