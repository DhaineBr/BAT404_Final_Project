INTRODUCTION

In the Philippines, it is important to have decent work and economic growth because many people are unemployed due to limited hiring by companies with high standards. SDG 8 of the United Nations aims to provide sufficient employment opportunities and promote the country's economic growth, which in turn helps reduce poverty and support families. The Philippines has an estimated population of 113,763,885 as of 2023, which leads to a high number of job vacancies and unemployment. The agriculture and industrial sectors make significant contributions to the country's economy. Their development is crucial in alleviating poverty and addressing economic challenges. 

To achieve decent work and economic growth in the Philippines, it is necessary to strengthen technologies and agricultural practices to ensure sustainable growth and provide employment opportunities for the country's residents. Establishing businesses in various regions of the Philippines can also help address the problem of job mismatch, where individuals work in fields unrelated to their educational background, leading to discomfort and dissatisfaction. The attainment of decent work and economic development in the Philippines requires integrated efforts from the government. Strengthening the labor sector can provide opportunities for the population to access employment.
