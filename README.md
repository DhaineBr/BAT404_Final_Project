# INTRODUCTION

The Gross Domestic Product of the Philippines has been slowly, yet constantly growing. The changes were likely driven by factors like labor inputs, education, technological advancement, progress in every industries, and other. According to the Biswas (2023), the Philippines' economy is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, with total GDP rising from USD 400 billion in 2021 to USD 830 billion in 2031. A key growth driver will be rapid growth in private consumption spending, buoyed by strong growth in urban household incomes [1]. Despite the optimistic outlook, Filipino trust ratings in business sectors have dipped from 75% in 2017 to 71% in 2019 (Philippine Trust Index, 2021). By 2021, the sector received a total of 66 percent trust on-ground rating — fewer respondents showed moderate trust in the sector at 48 percent, while the percentage of Filipinos who had extreme trust in the sector increased slightly to 18 percent [2]. The divided opinion about the Philippines' economic growth is somewhat understandable, considering that the behavioral patterns that can be seen in data concerning the Philippine economy had been unpredictable at some point. This is why extensive research should be conducted to have a better insight into what is about to happen based on existing data about the country’s economy. The aforementioned driving factors, if not taken into careful consideration, would likely cause misinformation.

The research will focus on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 where the researchers will provide insights that help promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Particularly, through Target 8.1 which aims to Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 percent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries [3].

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

A nation's GDP Growth, along with an increase in employment rate and average working hours, should be an indicator of great economic progress. In fact, in the Philippines' case, poverty incidence has also significantly reduced in the past decade. However, the data about the purchasing power of the Philippine Peso suggests otherwise since the country has also been suffering from a continuous increase in the inflation rate along with the progress of the aforementioned factors. 

The general economic dynamics and the elements causing this phenomenon raises questions in light of the decline in purchasing power. It highlights the importance of investigating and comprehending the underlying causes of this trend in order to develop effective strategies and policies to address the issue. While GDP growth may have remained steady, rising prices for goods and services, especially if wages and incomes do not keep up with inflation, can result in a decline in the population's standard of living.

# SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

The proposed project in the Philippines will have a big impact on reducing unemployment and fostering economic development. It focuses on technology, agriculture, and business establishment throughout many regions in order to create jobs. This would result in better livelihoods, a decrease in poverty, and higher levels of living. The proposal would improve worker rights and welfare by fortifying the labor sector, which would guarantee fair working conditions. Additionally, by emphasizing sustainable activities, it supports the aims of sustainable development globally and promotes climate resilience and environmental protection. By encouraging cooperation between the government, employees, and employers, the project's inclusive approach promotes more equal results. The project's ability to create jobs, spur economic growth, combat poverty, enhance working conditions, support sustainable development, and promote social equity make it significant overall.

The proposed project in the Philippines is crucial for tackling issues with unemployment and economic expansion. By improving agricultural methods, agricultural technologies, and business establishment across various locations, it seeks to increase employment prospects. This will boost people's and their families' standard of living while also promoting the growth and development of the economy as a whole.

# METHODS

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, focuses on promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Achieving SDG 8 requires addressing various challenges related to job creation, labor rights, economic productivity, and income inequality. Promoting decent work is essential for achieving sustainable development, reducing inequalities, and fostering inclusive economic growth. By prioritizing labor rights, fostering social dialogue, addressing informal employment, promoting gender equality, investing in education, supporting responsible business practices, and strengthening social protection, societies can create an enabling environment for decent work. Governments, employers, workers' organizations, and civil society must collaborate to implement these strategies, ensuring a brighter and more equitable future for all. By prioritizing decent work, we build the foundation for sustainable development and a more just and inclusive society.

# EXPECTED OUTPUTS

In furtherance of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, the goal of this study is to provide insights about the underlying factors that influence the economic growth of the Philippines. Since the factors isn't easy to determine, it is expected that the researchers will use different datasets where they'll base their recommendations in resolving the problem of inflation in the Philipines. By examining the correlations between different aspects of the economy, the researchers should be able to come up with feasible recommendations that would not only resolve the particular problem present in the conducted study, but also contribute to the overall advancement of Sustainable Development Goal 8.
