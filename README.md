# INTRODUCTION

The Gross Domestic Product of the Philippines has been slowly, yet constantly growing. The changes were likely driven by factors like labor inputs, education, technological advancement, progress in every industries, and other. According to the Biswas (2023), the Philippines' economy is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, with total GDP rising from USD 400 billion in 2021 to USD 830 billion in 2031. A key growth driver will be rapid growth in private consumption spending, buoyed by strong growth in urban household incomes [1]. Despite the optimistic outlook, Filipino trust ratings in business sectors have dipped from 75% in 2017 to 71% in 2019 (Philippine Trust Index, 2021). By 2021, the sector received a total of 66 percent trust on-ground rating — fewer respondents showed moderate trust in the sector at 48 percent, while the percentage of Filipinos who had extreme trust in the sector increased slightly to 18 percent [2]. The divided opinion about the Philippines' economic growth is somewhat understandable, considering that the behavioral patterns that can be seen in data concerning the Philippine economy had been unpredictable at some point. This is why extensive research should be conducted to have a better insight into what is about to happen based on existing data about the country’s economy. The aforementioned driving factors, if not taken into careful consideration, would likely cause misinformation.

The research will focus on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 where the researchers will provide insights that help promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Particularly, through Target 8.1 which aims to Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 percent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries [3].

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

A nation's GDP Growth, along with an increase in employment rate and average working hours, should be an indicator of great economic progress. In fact, in the Philippines' case, poverty incidence has also significantly reduced in the past decade. However, the data about the purchasing power of the Philippine Peso suggests otherwise since the country has also been suffering from a continuous increase in the inflation rate along with the progress of the aforementioned factors. 

The general economic dynamics and the elements causing this phenomenon raises questions in light of the decline in purchasing power. It highlights the importance of investigating and comprehending the underlying causes of this trend in order to develop effective strategies and policies to address the issue. While GDP growth may have remained steady, rising prices for goods and services, especially if wages and incomes do not keep up with inflation, can result in a decline in the population's standard of living.

# SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

This study gives an idea and how to give a solution to the poverty and increase the economic growth of our country. it will give our country a pattern of what it is going through and to provide a solution. SDG 8.1 For the purpose of decreasing poverty and raising both individual and collective living standards, sustained economic growth is essential. The report acknowledges the need to pull people out of severe poverty and give them greater possibilities for a good existence by striving for a high GDP growth rate, especially in the least developed nations. This research aims to know what to do and to help other countries that will have similar problems like this so that they can fight and know what to do to identify the problems they are suffering from.This study also shows the existence of decent work for every citizen in our country so that they can have a decent job.

•	Consumers -  ensures that all citizens, young or old, will have a decent work opportunity. regardless of age or gender people will have access to work. This includes fair wages, safe working conditions, and social protection. 

• Msme -  guarantees that small businesses will be supported to grow and create jobs. its purpose is to provide support in technologies and studies for Msme to develop and grow for the economy of our country.

• Government - the government is responsible for providing the law and how to provide a good way to increase economic growth. and implementing a full employment and ensuring labor rights and protection.

• Researchers - This will give an idea to the future researchers who will do this and they will have knowledge that will help in their development project and what are the methods of analyzing data and making graphs to determine what is the reason and the solution.


# METHODS

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, focuses on promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Achieving SDG 8 requires addressing various challenges related to job creation, labor rights, economic productivity, and income inequality. To do this, the researchers will conduct this study by analyzing and comparing datasets from Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) [4]. Behavioral patterns will be compared to determine which has the highest correlation with Inflation rate and Consumer Price Index (CPI). After that, the factor that behaves similar with inflation and CPI would be examined for the researches to be able to formulate feasible  recommendations aiming to address the issue. Since the datasets that'll be used contains progression over the span of eight (8) years, it is expected that the researchers will frequently use line chart, bar chart, and similar charts that represents progression for the data visualization part.

# EXPECTED OUTPUTS

In furtherance of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, the goal of this study is to provide insights about the underlying factors that influence the economic growth of the Philippines. Since the factors isn't easy to determine, it is expected that the researchers will use different datasets where they'll base their recommendations in resolving the problem of inflation in the Philipines. By examining the correlations between different aspects of the economy, the researchers should be able to come up with feasible recommendations that would not only resolve the particular problem present in the conducted study, but also contribute to the overall advancement of Sustainable Development Goal 8.
